##A collection of common classes and utilities for the Turing language

###What is it?
turing.lang is a collection designed to provide wrappers for Turing's primitive types, along with some common functionality that makes working in Turing just a bit easier.

###What does it include?
  * Wrappers for all Turing primitive types
  * Preconditions for checking if primitive fields are initialized to values
  * Functions for dynamically copying, allocating, and freeing memory
  * A unified Object hiearchy, with all turing.lang classes having equals, hashCode, and toString functions
  
###How do I use it?
Download the *turing* directory from this respository, and put it in the upper-level *support* directory of your Turing installation. The directory tree should look like
> %turing directory%/support/turing
